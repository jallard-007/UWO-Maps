 * Each map should also have the ability to display and hide layers. At a minimum, you should have a
 * layer for accessibility (this is built into the PDFs), a layer for washrooms (also built into the
 * PDFs), and a layer for each type of point of interest (e.g. classrooms, restaurants, labs, user
 * defined points of interest, etc.)
